<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing.

<p>If you are new to buying a forklift, carefully consider what type of forklift you need. Our expertise lies in a consultative approach to providing the best value-for-money forklift solution available to suit your needs.
