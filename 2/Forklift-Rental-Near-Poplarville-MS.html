Growing industrialization is anticipated to drive the demand for pallet trucks, especially from non-traditional industries in growing economies in Asia Pacific.

<p>At Laura Buick GMC, we are the best lifted truck dealership near St Louis. So if you need additional materials handling equipment to keep your business up and running, we can help. A 2000kg load can be sufficiently moved with some effort; however, with poor ground, a poor quality pallet jack, unstable loads, slopes, etc., it will be much more difficult for the pallet jack worker.</p>

Skids were the first pallets ever produced, appearing in American factories along with low-lift trucks in the late 1880s.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
