Linde offers many additional options for all pallet trucks. The AM 22 hand pallet truck is also available in low-noise form. Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>
