<h3>Forklift Truck Mast Mill Valley CA</h3>
<p>While standard counterbalance forklifts need a good amount of space to make turns, a three-wheel forklift can actually spin in a very tight circle. Of course, Chevrolet already produces a number of fantastic off-road trucks with dedicated trims designed to take on a wide range of trails out there. They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>

A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse. The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>
