<p>First forklifts appeared already in the early 20th century, and were used in World War II. Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking. Our hand pallet jack import data solutions meet your actual import requirements in quality, volume, seasonality, and geography.</p>

Moreover, an optical sensor mounted on the load section can automatically lower pallets to an ideal working height.</p>
