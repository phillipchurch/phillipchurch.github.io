Some forklifts use a single hydraulic cylinder to elevate the boom, while others use two cylinders. While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects.</p>
<p>Longer term rental equipment is better addressed with a charger that will need to be wired in at your site by a licensed electrician. The fall-arresting system must not interfere with the raising and lowering of the forklift platforms. Cat lift Trucks has developed two specialised order pickers to meet these needs.

As rental rates can be assessed differently, spelling out the time period can save you money by getting reduced long-term rates or reducing the term of your rental to the tightest possible time period.</p>
