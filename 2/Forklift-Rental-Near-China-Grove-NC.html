Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty.

They're the most common type of cargo transport truck in stores, but they're also popular in warehouses and distribution centers, too. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>
