At Durante Rentals, we rent forklifts and telehandlers for all your material handling needs.</p>

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Every forklift has an identification plate that lists important information about the truck. We are working hard to protect the health and safety of your team and ours while continuing to provide equipment and services. Stand-Up Trucks: Stand-up trucks are the most common reach forklifts. Equipped with our exclusive ACR System, the 5500 Orderpicker has lower maintenance and parts costs, fewer service requirements, increased battery performance, and superior truck utilization rates compared to DC-powered lift trucks.</p>
