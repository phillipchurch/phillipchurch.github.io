<p>The Linde forklifts are distinguished by their innovative industrial technology, ensuring customer confidence in the brand. The electric engine is a key improvement in forklift design. Additionally, each of our counterbalance forklift trucks includes easy-to-use features common in every Cat lift truck and a range of optional extras to ensure you get the configuration best suited to your needs.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
