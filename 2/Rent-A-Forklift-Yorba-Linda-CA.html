Equipment dealers generally have a much wider range of rental equipment to meet a broader range of applications. With rated load capacities commonly ranging between 5,500 lbs and 12,000 lbs, popular models include power shift transmission and all-wheel steering as well as a number of additional steering features that allow the operator to position the lift as close to the work area as possible.</p>

<p>There is nothing like the ride that is achieved from air suspension. The order picker forklift has a small platform big enough for the operator to stand behind the forks with controls for operating the forks. Suspension lift kits can raise a truck a full foot from where it started, and they aren't just lifting up the truck's body and putting it back again. Counterbalanced and noncounterbalanced Fork Lift Trucks and Reach Trucks — The maximum weight; expressed in pounds, of a 48 inches homogeneous cube (24 inches load center) that a truck can transport and stack to a height established by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Beyond the size and power source, when choosing a forklift you need to evaluate a variety of factors that impact your long-term cost, including how much and how high the machine can lift, how careful you need to be when manipulating the load in sensitive areas and whether you should buy or rent a forklift. The Multi-Task Control Handle allows operators to manage travel direction and speed while maneuvering during lift and reach operations.</p>

<p>Aside from these two distinct types of a forklift, there are many other varieties available. Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can ‘reach' into racking. Low noise and vibration, excellent all-round visibility and easy servicing allow for improved driver comfort and forklift truck durability.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
