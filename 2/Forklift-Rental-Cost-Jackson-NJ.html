<h2>Get Pallet Trucks Online At The Best Price Jackson </h2>
<p>Perhaps the inventory that needs to be moved will pay for the rentals, or money is just tight right now. Save time and money with the compact and manoeuvrable 25 industrial forklift.

In our inventory you can explore a variety of new and used electric, internal combustion, and rough terrain forklifts, as well as a number of boom lifts and floor cleaners.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>

<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company.

As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
