The PTH Series hand pallet jack features solid construction and generous use of steel - especially at critical stress points - to deliver for long-lasting performance. Delivery and pickup are not usually included in a forklift rental agreement. We employ a team of skilled professionals, who fabricate these products in varied configurations by using best quality raw material and progressive technology.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>Details such as window tint, fog lights, running boards and lift kits depend on personal preference, so at Carlsbad Chevrolet, we give you the options to decide the best modifications for your pickup. When in doubt, ask an expert in the forklift rental industry for advice. Vertical-mast rough terrain forklifts are ruggedly constructed and are designed to be used outdoors.</p>

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs.
