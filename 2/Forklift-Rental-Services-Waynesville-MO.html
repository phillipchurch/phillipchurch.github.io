Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>

This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks.

<p>While electric forklifts will require less maintenance, they will never be maintenance free. To achieve worker safety, Raymond developed the Raymond virtual reality (VR) simulator , a supplemental educational tool that helps new and experienced operators learn and practice forklift operating skills on an actual truck in a secure, warehouse environment. They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
<p>These trucks are required for loading and unloading the materials and carrying it from one place to another. Our team of engineers developed our EWRS-RTF series of jcb rough terrain forklift tires to be easily repaired if damaged, although we are not sure you will need to with the quality that went into our design and components.
