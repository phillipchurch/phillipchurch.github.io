<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>

The counterbalance‚Äù term refers to the weight distribution for cargo loads; any pallets or merchandise are counterbalanced against the weight of the machine.

<p>For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1, of at full rearward till permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, whichever is less stable, Where tilt restrictions for various elevations are employed, and the rearward tilt position is determined to be less stable, the truck should be tested at maximum elevation for each tilt restriction permitted by the truck mechanism.</p>
