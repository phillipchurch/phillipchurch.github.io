I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>

On a powered pallet truck, however, the lifting of the load, and truck movement, is powered by the electric motor within the machine.</p>
