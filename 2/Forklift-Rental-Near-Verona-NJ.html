<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. You must consider whether the forklift will be working indoors or outdoors, whether it will work on smooth floors or rough terrain and what lift heights and types of product or materials will be involved.

Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust. From the moment you first step into the reception area, decorated with handmade up-cycled furniture built from old pallets to the large warehouse space where the forklifts, order pickers, boom, and scissor lifts all operate, we have made a huge effort for the whole place to be a positive, professional, clean, modern and friendly environment.</p>

A suspension lift is a modification to a vehicle to raise the ride height It is done for the purpose of improving the off road performance of SUVs or trucks and other off-road vehicles , or for cosmetic purposes. This type of forklift cannot be used for indoor applications.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out.

The PTH Series pallet jacks include a manual and a powered scissor lift model, which offer productivity-enhancing options; they can be used as hand pallet trucks, as storage tables or as workbenches.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
