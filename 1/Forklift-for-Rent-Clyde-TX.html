<h3>Electric Forklift Rental Clyde TX</h3>

With over 50 years of supporting Australian forklift users - we are here for the long run so if you want to make the smart choice, call Toyota Material Handling today. Critics favor Toyota's electric forklift product line over the gas engine.</p>

The Toyota Order Picker easily maneuvers narrow aisles in warehouses with minimized rack impact during case picking thanks to optional wire guidance and double rail guidance systems. Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>

It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
