<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>About 41% of these are forklifts, 1% are truck body parts, and 1% are digital signage and displays. Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site.
