On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

Electric models offer a substantially lower cost per hour-of-operation than any of the internal combustion lifts. If you are unsure of what you want in a car, you need to create a shortlist of the trucks that appeal to you.</p>
