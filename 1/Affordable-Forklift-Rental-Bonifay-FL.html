<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame.

<p>For off road purposes, lifting a truck is the best way to improve its performance. In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period. In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles. When the operator is done with pallet jack, he or she shouldn't leave the equipment just sitting out anywhere.</p>
<p>In the event of a crash with a lifted truck, the injuries can be extensive. Furthermore, training enables an operator to operate the equipment in a safe manner, which reduces potential accidents. The convenience of forklifts grew so much so that a great many used indoor lifts can be found in farms today. Contact your local MCFA forklift dealer to learn about your rental options.</p>
