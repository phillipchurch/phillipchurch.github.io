A suspension lift is a modification to a vehicle to raise the ride height It is done for the purpose of improving the off road performance of SUVs or trucks and other off-road vehicles , or for cosmetic purposes. This type of forklift cannot be used for indoor applications.</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48” will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work.
