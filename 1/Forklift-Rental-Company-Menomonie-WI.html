<p>Like the LHM230P, the BT Pro Lifter, LHT100 is designed to work with minimal starting force for increased productivity during horizontal transport and loading operations. However, reach trucks are not really designed for outdoor use. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front. Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts are used at industrial sites where uneven surfaces can exist. While there is no single best pallet jack, high-quality pallet jacks are made by companies such as Linde or Jungheinrich. These reliable reach trucks offer the operator the high-quality, comfortable and spacious position that makes the work safe and enjoyable. And, the Raymond Model 8410 pallet truck with second-level pick steps offers three heavy-duty, non-slip steps—accessible from either side of the truck—that lead to a picking platform for easy access to second-level load beams.</p>
