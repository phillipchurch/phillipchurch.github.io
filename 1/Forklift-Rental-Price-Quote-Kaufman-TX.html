We have seen that business owners who use a hand pallet truck give much productivity per day. This machine is designed with a low stowed height to allow for superior maneuverability through entryways. Raymond stand up and sit down forklifts come equipped with exclusive features and technologies, delivering superior visibility, exceptional ergonomics, and unmatched efficiency.</p>

Class VII: Rough terrain forklift trucks - Exclusively for outdoor use, these trucks handle rough terrains such as unimproved construction sites. Pallet trucks are used for unloading and stuffing goods that are delivered on the pallet such as cartons and tinned goods.</p>
