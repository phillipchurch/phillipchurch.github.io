In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period. In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles.

We've got forklifts reserved and maintained for rental customers, with everything from forklift hand pallet trucks, powered pallet truck forklifts and stacking forklifts through to 12 tonne forklifts and specialised very narrow aisle equipment.</p>

Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
