This is best if you have a large warehouse or need different types of lifts for the jobs you'll be doing. If you test drive your lifted trucks hurriedly, you will fail to pay close attention to some signs you should be watching out for.

Our range of Rough Terrain Pallet Truck is scientifically designed to achieve maximum production capacity with minimum human efforts. Built on RICO's many years of lift truck experience, the Pegasus Series trucks are designed for demanding applications that require clean, quiet-running, heavy-duty capabilities.</p>

The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks also present a danger to those driving in them. The fuel-efficient cushion tire forklifts from Cat, with lift capacities from 3,000 to 15,500 lbs., are ideal for use in indoor applications with smooth, dry floors, where moving palletized loads to and from a loading dock or storage area is required.

Unlike other forklifts, these material handling vehicles don't have cabs.
