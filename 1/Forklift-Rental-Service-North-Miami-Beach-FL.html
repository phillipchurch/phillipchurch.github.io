Whatever materials handling task you need fulfilling, Cat Lift Trucks offer you one of the most dependable and complete counterbalance forklifts in the industry.

<p>In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators. Rough terrain forklifts have inflatable tires with thicker treads which allows it to gain stability on uneven surfaces. Some industrial reach forklift trucks have a mechanism allowing its cab to tilt, enabling the operator to have a more convenient position while viewing.</p>
<p>The idea behind it is always the same: Every pallet truck from Linde should be able to be controlled effortlessly with only one hand.

The product has been designed and manufactured for maximum load capacity.</p>
