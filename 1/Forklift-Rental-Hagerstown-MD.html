<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks.

<p>Never use a diesel engine, internal combustion gas, or propane powered lift truck models in confined spaces for long periods of time.
