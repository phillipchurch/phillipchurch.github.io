When there is no load, it is also possible to reposition the pallet jack by pushing it. Rough terrain and semi-industrial forklift from 2,000 to 2,500kg. Raymond stand up and sit down forklifts delivers superior visibility, exceptional ergonomics and unmatched efficiency, making them the best performing counterbalanced forklifts in the industry.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
