This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks.

<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028.
